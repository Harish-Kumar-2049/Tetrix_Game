"# Tetrix_Game" 
A Tetris game is a tile-matching puzzle game
Different geometric shapes made of four squares (called tetrominoes) fall from the top of the screen.
The player rotates and moves the blocks horizontally to fit them into a well
When a horizontal line is completely filled with blocks, it clears, and the blocks above it drop down.
The game ends when the blocks stack to the top of the playing field, preventing new pieces from entering.
